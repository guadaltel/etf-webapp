== Information used by all Executable Test Suites

=== Overview

All Executable Test Suites can make use of and reference generic information items that is used by ETF to organize Executable Test Suites and present test reports to a user.

How these items are referenced in the different types of Executable Test Suites is described in the section for each test engine.

These items are:

* Collections of multi-lingual message templates for use in test reports for one or more Executable Test Suites
* Tags that may be associated with an Executable Test Suite to support grouping and filtering

CAUTION: #What about TestObjectType and StatisticalReportTableType?#

These items that stored as XML documents in the  `include-metadata`
directory of an ETF deployment (see link:http://[#add link where the directory structure is described#]).
