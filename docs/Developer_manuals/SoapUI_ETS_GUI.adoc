=== Development environment

A SoapUI Executable Test Suite is developed and tested using the
SoapUI GUI application.

==== Installation

Prerequisites for the following steps to set up the ETS development environment are:

* Windows OS (it may work on Linux, too, but it is known to not work under macOS)
* Java 1.8
* SoapUI 5.3.0 installed

Then follow these steps under Windows:

1. Download link:https://services.interactive-instruments.de/etfdev-af/etf-public-dev/de/interactive_instruments/etf/suim/SoapUI-ETF.zip[this ZIP file] (using "etf-public-dev" as username and password)
2. Extract the ZIP file in any directory
3. Run 'install-plugins.bat'
4. Run 'SoapUI 5.3.0.bat'

To load the plugins, SoapUI must always be started with the 'SoapUI 5.3.0.bat' file from the extracted directory.

NOTE: This procedure is required as link:https://github.com/SmartBear/soapui/pull/201[Smartbear decided to lock out unsigned plugins]. Because the signing process is not transparent to us, we decided to use this workaround.

==== First steps

Start SoapUI with the 'SoapUI 5.3.0.bat' batch file. After the user interface
appears, open the 'Tutorial workspace' by clicking on 'File' -> 'Switch workspace',
then select the file 'tutorial-soapui-workspace.xml' from the 'SoapUI ETF\tutorial'
directory.

The workspace should open and load the 'Tutorial - Pre-defined WFS' test project.

To test whether the extension is working properly, a web service can be tested
with the test project 'Tutorial - Pre-defined WFS'. Therefore click on the
test project and then on 'Custom Properties' in the lower left corner. Change
the 'serviceEndpoint' property by double clicking on the 'Value' cell.

Enter the URL to a INSPIRE Pre-defined download service. The test project will
check if the GetCapabilities response is schema valid and that an
INSPIRE ExtendedCapabilities element exists. To see the test fail, a URL to a
WFS 2.0 service without an ExtendedCapabilities element can also be entered.

==== Executing tests

To execute a test suite against a web service set the serviceEndpoint property
and the username and password (authUser and authPwd properties) if the service
requires authentication. These properties can be changed after clicking on
the test project and then on 'Custom Properties' in the lower left corner.

Double click on the test project, click on the 'Test Suites' tab
and start the test run with a click on the green arrow.
