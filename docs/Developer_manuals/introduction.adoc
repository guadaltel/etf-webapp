== Introduction

The ETF validator provides a framework for executing test suites in various test
engines. Currently three test engines are supported: SoapUI,
BaseX and the TEAM Engine. SoapUI and the TEAM Engine are used for web service
based tests, BaseX is used for testing huge sets of XML documents.
This document provides a guide on how test suites for the test engines SoapUI
and BaseX can be developed. Please see

for developing test suites for the Team Engine.
