== Introduction

This document is a guide on how to develop Executable Test Suites for ETF using the test engines SoapUI, BaseX and the TEAM Engine.

The concepts in ETF are based on ISO 19105 and the OGC Specification Model. Key concepts introduced by these two standards are Conformance Classes and Executable Test Suites.

A Conformance Class is a set of requirements defined in a specification. To pass the conformance class, a resource claiming conformance with that class must meet all the requirements.

An Executable Test Suite is a collection of tests that validates a resource against all the requirements in the associated Conformance Class.

ETF is built on these concepts as they underpin the standards and specifications that are used in Spatial Data Infrastructures and that are typically tested by validators based on ETF.

The resources that we want to test with ETF have different characteristics.

When testing GML data, test expressions will typically use XPath to express the assertions. Typical challenges in this case are performance for large datasets (10s or 100s of Gigabytes) and testing spatial aspects.

When we test an OGC web service, for example a Web Feature Service, the execution of the tests needs to be dynamic. The capabilities of the service need to be analyzed, test cases and assertions need to be generated based on the analysis of the feature types, their properties, the coordinate reference systems, the stored queries, the filter capabilities supported, etc. As a result, the execution of a test suite is a complex interaction between the validator and the web service and the Executable Test Suite not only needs to test responses from the web service, but also determine from the response what needs to be tested.

To address the different challenges properly, ETF supports different tools ("test engines") to execute Executable Test Suites. Currently supported are the following test engines:

* link:http://soapui.org/[SoapUI], a widely used tool for testing web services
* link:http://basex.org/[BaseX], an XML database, for testing sets of XML documents - including very large ones
* link:http://opengeospatial.github.io/teamengine[TEAM Engine], the tool used by the OGC CITE tests, to support the modern CITE tests developed using TestNG

The BaseX extension module link:https://github.com/interactive-instruments/etf-gmlgeox[GmlGeoX] extends XQuery to enable testing spatial aspects of GML features (geometry validation, spatial indexing, spatial predicates).

Due to the different characteristics of the test engines, the development of an Executable Test Suite is very different for each test engine.

For each of the supported test engines, ETF has specified a mapping from the concepts of the test engine to the ETF concepts so that test results in ETF are homogenous - whatever test engines are used in a test run.

This guide, therefore, describes how to use the test engines in a way that is consistent with the ETC concepts. It is *not* a tutorial for the test engines (SoapUI, BaseX, TEAM Engine) or the relevant technologies (XML, XQuery, HTTP, Groovy, etc.). We assume working knowledge with the relevant tools and technologies. We have included links that should help to familiarize yourself with the relevant tools and technologies, where this is needed.

for developing test suites for the Team Engine.

WARNING: !!! The last paragraph needs to go to the relevant section.
