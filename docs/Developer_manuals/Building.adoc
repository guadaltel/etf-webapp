== Prerequisites

- link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java SE Development Kit JDK 8 installed]
- Ensure JAVA_HOME environment variable is set
- link:https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git installed]

== Accessing the source code

The code base of the web application can be cloned from link:https://github.com/interactive-instruments/etf-webapp[GitHub].

NOTE: because the ETF version 2 is not finally released, the next branch must be used.

[source,bash]
----
git clone -b next https://github.com/interactive-instruments/etf-webapp.git
----

== Compiling the source code

ETF uses link:https://gradle.org[Gradle] as build management tool. The gradle
wrapper script will automatically download the required Gradle version and
start the build process afterwards.

Dependencies are downloaded from the interactive instruments repositories.
Currently only the snapshot repository can be accessed with the credentials
etf-public-releases / etf-public-releases . This is automatically done by
default.

[NOTE]
====
The repository to be used is determined from the version.properties file.
Make sure the version is suffixed with "-SNAPSHOT". If necessary, change the
version in the version.properties file, for example to:

----
version = 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
----
====


.On a Windows command line run
[source,cmd]
----
C:\etf-webapp> gradlew.bat build
----

.On Linux execute
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew build
----

== Running the web application

The web application can be started by executing the *jettyRun* task.

.On a Windows command line run
[source,cmd]
----
C:\etf-webapp> gradlew.bat jettyRunWar
----

.On Linux execute
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew.sh jettyRunWar
----

The web application can then be accessed at link:http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080].

== Building other ETF components
The web application depends on several other ETF components:

- link:https://github.com/interactive-instruments/etf-core[etf-core] ETF core library including API and domain model
- link:https://github.com/interactive-instruments/etf-spi[etf-spi] ETF Service Provider Interface
- link:https://github.com/interactive-instruments/etf-bsxds[etf-bsxds] ETF data storage based on the BaseX database
- link:https://github.com/interactive-instruments/etf-suitd[etf-suitd] ETF SoapUI test driver
- link:https://github.com/interactive-instruments/etf-sui-ae[etf-sui-ae] ETF test driver adapter and extensions for SoapUI
- link:https://github.com/interactive-instruments/etf-sui-ae[etf-bsxtd] ETF BaseX test driver

The source code of the components must be cloned using GIT
(otherwise a 'repository not found' error occurs).

NOTE: because the ETF version 2 is not finally released, the next branches must be used.

Changed components can be installed into the local maven repository with the
gradle *install* command and be used by the etf-webapp component afterwards.

== FAQ
Q: I get a `repository not found` error.

A: The error occurs for example if the source code has been downloaded and not
cloned with GIT -or the directory has been copied without the hidden .git
directory. The build helper script (etf-bda) collects information from the
locally cloned GIT repository and includes the property `Implementation-Revision`
in the manifest file:
----
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Build-Date: 170601013212
Implementation-Version: 2.0.0
Build-Gradle: 3.5
Build-ii-bda: 1.0.24.1
Implementation-Revision: abf509f
Source-Compatibility: 1.8
Implementation-Build: 0
Build-Host: JAX
Build-User: herrmann
Build-JDK: 1.8.0_102
----
You can fix the problem by cloning the repository from GitHub using GIT.
