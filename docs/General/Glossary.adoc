|  *Term / Synonyms* | *Definition*
|abstract test case

conformance test case |test for a particular requirement or a set of related requirements

_Source: OGC Specification Model_

NOTE: An abstract or conformance test case is a formal basis for deriving executable test cases. It should be complete in the sense that it is sufficient to enable a test verdict to be assigned unambiguously to each potentially observable test outcome.


|abstract test module

conformance test module |set of related tests, all within a single conformance class

_Source: OGC Specification Model_

|abstract test suite

ATS |set of conformance classes that define tests for all requirements of a specification

_Source: derived from OGC Specification Model and ISO 19105_

|API |set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software and applications

_Source: Wikipedia_

NOTE: In the INSPIRE Test Framework, APIs are used for the internal communication between the components of the test framework and to allow machines to communicate with the INSPIRE Test Framework.

|conformance class |set of conformance test modules that must be applied to receive a single certificate of conformance

_Source: OGC Specification Model_

|consistency test |test case that includes one or more test assertions involving information from both the test object and from a resource referenced from the test object
|executable test suite

ETS |set of executable test cases

_Source: ISO 19105_

|executable test suite set |set of executable test suites
|requirement |expression in the content of a document conveying criteria to be fulfilled if compliance with the document is to be claimed and from which no deviation is permitted

_Source: ISO Directives Part 2_

|specification |document containing recommendations, requirements and conformance tests for those requirements

_Source: OGC Specification Model_

|test assertion |atomic test in a test step

NOTE: The assertion tests information retrieved from the test object in a test step against the an expected value based on the requirements associated with the test case.

|test case

executable test case |specific test of an implementation to meet particular requirements

_Source: ISO 19105_

NOTE: Instantiation of an abstract test case with values.

|test driver |component of the test framework that communicates with a test engine during a test run
|test engine |a tool that executes an Executable Test Suite
|test framework |platform that supports multiple test engines, multiple test object types and the generation of harmonised test reports across the different test engines
|test object

SUT |Â asset / system under test
|test object type |classification of a test object

NOTE: An Executable Test Suite declares which types of test objects it supports. This allows to determine which Executable Test Suites may be included in a test run against a test object. Test object types are structured in a hierarchical vocabulary.

|test report |report derived from the test result

NOTE: reports may be human readable (HTML) or machine-readable (XML, JSON) and they may be structured in different ways (usually by test suite, module, case, step and assertion).

|test result |result of a test run
|test run |execution of one or more test tasks

NOTE: in a test run one or more Executable Test Suites will be executed against one or more test objects.

|test step |an interaction with a test object as part of a test case

NOTE: Multiple steps may be necessary to execute a test case. A test step will be, for example, a query on data or a request on a web service. The result of the interaction is then subject to assertions.

|test task |execution of an Executable Test Suite against a test object
|validation test |test case that is executed on the test object alone
