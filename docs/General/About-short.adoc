== About ETF

ETF is an open source testing framework for validating spatial data, metadata and web services in Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs). It can be used via a responsive web application or via a REST API.

The design of ETF is driven by three goals: be user-friendly, consistency with the standards and the capability to test all resources in an SDI.
