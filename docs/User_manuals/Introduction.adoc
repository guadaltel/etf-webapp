In the *Start test* section all available (respectively installed) Executable Test
Suites are listed. Within this section, an Executable Test Suite can be
selected and run against a Test Object. A Test Object can be a single or
multiple artifacts like GML files or a whole system like a Web Feature
Service.

The *Status* section shows all tests that are currently executed on the
system and enables the user to open a monitor view for single test runs.

The *Test reports* section list the test results of completed test runs
ordered by their start date.

The *Help* link refers to this page.
