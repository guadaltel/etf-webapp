These information include:

Executable Test Suite has been derived (Source)
* may include Test Suite dependencies which are automatically executed
with the Test Suite in a Test Run (Pre-requisite conformance classes)
* may include the name of associated Tags that are used to group the
Test Suites in the view
* the name of applicable Test Object Types (explained in the next
section)

ETS selection"]

A _Start_ button appears once at least one Test Suite is selected.

A Test Suite is applicable to certain Test Object Types, that are listed
in the description. Multiple Test Suites can be selected for one Test
Run, but must be applicable to the same Test Object Type. Once one Test
Suite is selected, the flip switch of all Test Suites, that have
different Test Object Types, are disabled.

A Test Suite may depend on other Test Suites. The dependencies are also
shown in the description of the Test Suites. These dependencies are also
automatically executed during the test run.

A click on the _Start_ button will open a new view that asks the user
about the target to be tested.

The _Label_ field is mandatory but automatically preset with the current
time and names of the selected Test Suites. The Label will be shown in
the _Test reports_ overview and can be changed in order to help finding
the report again after a test run.

The style of the view may depend on the selected Test Suites.

=== File-based Tests

The following elements are shown when Test Suites have been selected
that test one or multiple test data files.

If _File upload_ is selected as _Data source_ one or multiple local
files can be selected and uploaded to the Validator. The Validator only
accepts files with XML and GML file ending and ZIP files containing
these two file types. All other files like schema files can not be used
and are silently ignored by the Validator!

The maximum uploadable file size is displayed when the mouse is over the
question mark with the blue background.

If the data are available on the web they can be tested by providing one
single URL. After _Remote file (URL)_ has been selected as __Data
source__, an URL to either one single XML, GML or a ZIP file can be
entered.

If the URL requires authentication, username and password can be
provided by clicking on __Credentials__.
