The console area shows information and result messages. The Test Run can
be canceled with a click on the _Cancel_ button.

The view can be left for instance with the X Button in the upper left
corner. The Test Run execution continues on the server.

To reattach to a Monitor View select in the menu bar the _Status_ view.
The Status view shows all running tests. A click on the Test Run opens
the Monitor View of that Test Run again.

is displayed automatically.
