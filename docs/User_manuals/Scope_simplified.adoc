This manual is intended for users that are using a central
deployed validator to test geo network services and data. Services must be
accessible via the internet but can be protected with basic authentication.
Small test data sets can be uploaded or downloaded by the validator
by providing an URL.

If your services are not publicly accessible via the internet or data can
not be uploaded, ask your Administrator to set up a organization-internal
deployment of the ETF validator.
