This manual is intended for users that are using a centrally
deployed validator to test geo network services and data. Services must be
accessible via the internet but can be protected with the HTTP basic
authentication mechanism. Small test data sets can be uploaded or
downloaded by the validator by providing an URL.

NOTE: The default upload limit for data sets is 500 Megabytes but may be
changed by the system administrator.

If your services are not publicly accessible via the internet or data can
not be uploaded, ask your Administrator to set up a organization-internal
deployment of the ETF validator.
