= Inspect test reports

The top of a Test Report shows general information including the overall
test result __Status__, the start time, the duration and a statistical
table, which summarizes the status of all tests on several levels.

The Test Reports are interactive. The _Show_ switch can be used to
filter _Only failed_ or _Only manual_ tests. The _Level of detail_
switch is used to show additional information in the reports.

The test results are summarized hierarchically in a report. At the top
level there are the Test Suites.

By clicking on one test suite a description and all lower level tests in
that test suite are shown. Failures in a test suite can be immediately
recognized by the red color. The number of failed tests is shown in the
right corner.

The green color indicates a passed test. A passed test which requires
further manual test steps that could not be automated are colored
orange. The orange color may also indicate a test that has been skipped
as it depends on another test that have been failed. The exact status
can be found below the description.

The number of levels depends on the tested Test Object. If service tests
have been executed the hierarchy is as follows:

* Executable Test Suites
* Test Modules (bundles Test Cases)
* Test Cases (bundles Test Steps)
* Test Steps (interactions with the service, bundles Test Assertions)
* Test Assertions (atomar tests)

In a file-based test, Test Modules and Test Steps do not exist and are
not shown in the report.

Each test provides a description on how aspects are tested and lists the
requirements. The test may possess a link to an abstract test suite,
from which the test has been derived (Source).

Assertions stand for atomar test queries on the lowest level. Failed,
red colored assertions display rrror messages in the _Messages_ section.

Helpful information may also be found on the next higher level, like for
instance the response from a service on the Test Step level (note the
_Open saved response_ link in the report).
